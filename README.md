# SEO reporting @GoogleColab

Created with Colab Notebook to achieve a shareable online dashboard.

## What you need
- A Google account with access to Drive and Colab Notebooks
- Google Analytics Reporting API enabled
- Google Search Console API enabled
- Ranktracking tool (I use SEMrush) 

## Why should I care?
Use one single Colab Notebook with one single click to get a full report of the latest data of your account.

## So, how does it work?
There are a few seperate files. The 'main.ipynb' file runs the scripts, asks permission at Google Drive (authentication stuff) and does a little bit of styling.

## What's next?
- Integration with ScreamingFrog for a top priority list of technical issues
- Year on Year comparison Google Analytics data
- Auto-update SEMrush rankings into Google Drive
- Pivot filtered table of keyword rankings
